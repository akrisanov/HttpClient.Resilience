# Contributing to HttpClient.Resilience

Thank you for your interest in contributing to HttpClient.Resilience! This guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Your favorite IDE (Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider, etc.)

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HttpClient.Resilience.git
   cd HttpClient.Resilience
   ```

3. Restore dependencies and build:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   ```

4. Run tests to ensure everything works:

   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## Making Changes

### Branch Strategy

- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix
- Use descriptive branch names:
  - `feature/add-timeout-configuration`
  - `fix/circuit-breaker-race-condition`
  - `docs/update-configuration-examples`

### Code Style

We follow standard .NET coding conventions:

- Use PascalCase for public members
- Use camelCase for private fields and local variables
- Add XML documentation for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and small
- Write descriptive variable and method names

### Writing Tests

- All new features must include tests
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use FluentAssertions for assertions

Example:

```csharp
[Fact]
public void AddResilience_WithNullOptions_ShouldThrowArgumentNullException()
{
    // Arrange
    var services = new ServiceCollection();
    var builder = services.AddHttpClient("test");

    // Act & Assert
    var exception = Assert.Throws<ArgumentNullException>(() =>
        builder.AddResilience((HttpClientOptions)null));

    exception.ParamName.Should().Be("options");
}
```

### Documentation

- Update documentation for any API changes
- Add examples for new features
- Update the changelog for breaking changes
- Ensure all public APIs have XML documentation

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. Ensure all tests pass:

   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

2. Check for code style issues:

   ```bash
   dotnet format --verify-no-changes
   ```

3. Update documentation if needed
4. Add or update tests for your changes

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title
   - ‚úÖ "Add support for custom timeout configuration"
   - ‚ùå "Fix stuff"

2. **Description**: Include:
   - What changes were made and why
   - Any breaking changes
   - Links to related issues
   - Screenshots/examples if applicable

3. **Scope**: Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
4. **Tests**: Include tests for new functionality
5. **Documentation**: Update docs for user-facing changes

### Pull Request Template

```markdown
## Description
Brief description of the changes.

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [ ] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes

## Checklist
- [ ] My code follows the style guidelines of this project
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation

```

## Development Guidelines

### API Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Default configuration should work for 80% of use cases
2. **Explicit Configuration**: Advanced options should be clearly documented
3. **Fail Fast**: Invalid configurations should throw exceptions early
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Avoid breaking changes when possible
5. **Consistent Patterns**: Follow existing conventions in the codebase

### Performance Considerations

- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Use `ValueTask` where appropriate
- Consider thread safety for shared resources
- Profile performance for critical paths

### Error Handling

- Use specific exception types for different error scenarios
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Include context information in exceptions
- Handle edge cases gracefully

## Types of Contributions

### Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

- Clear description of the issue
